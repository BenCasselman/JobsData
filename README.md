R code to parse public labor market data

These are mostly basic scripts to download and parse public labor-market data. I may add my actual analytic scripts in the future, but for now these are mostly just scripts for getting/formatting the data for other work.
These scripts work with readily available series from the Current Population Survey, Current Employment Statistics and similar BLS datasets.
For scripts dealing with the more detailed microdata files, see the separate Microdata repository.
